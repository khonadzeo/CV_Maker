# CV_Maker
Web Api contains 3 endpoints 
one post endpoint to create personal details,
one get endpoint to retrieve personal details  by id ,
and last end point which generates a downloadable pdf cv document from the personal Information provided.
it was created using  entityframe work, its a .net6.0
Please note that this is just a simple cv maker that i used to demonstrate my understanding of C# and web APIs
hences it features only 3 neccesarry Endpoints for this project to function ,how ever i used some good coding techniques ,
such as dependency injection ,just to lower the amount of instanciations through out the code
includes abstraction , and using of interfaces calling methods in repositories via their interfaces all the way to the controller
Code also includes a lot of documentation as it has comments throughout
